History
Substitution cipher and breaking it
Vigenere's Cipher
Rotor Machines
DES
AES

Define block cipher
Vernam cipher, OTP

Shannon perfect secrecy definition - Pr over all keys for any 2 messages
and any ciphertext that E(k, m_i)=c is same.

Recap
Stream ciphers make OTP practical
  PRG, predictability and unpredictablity definitions
  weak PRG - linear congruential generator 
    broken
    glibc
    r[i]=r[i-3]+r[i-31] mod 2^32
  used in Kerberos v4

Attacks on OTP
  Two time pad - Project Venona and MPEE
  No integrity, i.e., malleability

  Hybrid encryption is better to use
  E(k, f) := AES(k, r) || f xor g(r)

RC4 discussion
  802.11b's RC4 implementation (WEP)

  m||crc(m) xor rc4(IV||k) = ciphertext
  publish (ciphertext, IV)

  Problem: IV is counter (sometimes), initializes to zero on reboot and
  frequently wraps around (2^24 IVs only)

  [FMShamir '01] first byte of RC4(0||k) ... RC4(10^6||k) => you can find k

Hardware stream ciphers
  LFSRs
  How they were badly used in DVD CSS

Good ciphers?
  ESTREAM project
  Trivium, well-designed
