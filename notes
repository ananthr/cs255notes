Define block cipher
Vernam cipher, OTP

Shannon perfect secrecy definition - Pr over all keys for any 2 messages
and any ciphertext that E(k, m_i)=c is same.

Recap
Stream ciphers make OTP practical
  PRG, predictability and unpredictablity definitions
  weak PRG - linear congruential generator 
    broken
    glibc
    r[i]=r[i-3]+r[i-31] mod 2^32
  used in Kerberos v4

Attacks on OTP
  Two time pad - Project Venona and MPEE
  No integrity, i.e., malleability

  Hybrid encryption is better to use
  E(k, f) := AES(k, r) || f xor g(r)

RC4 discussion
  802.11b's RC4 implementation (WEP)

  m||crc(m) xor rc4(IV||k) = ciphertext
  publish (ciphertext, IV)

  Problem: IV is counter (sometimes), initializes to zero on reboot and
  frequently wraps around (2^24 IVs only)

  [FMShamir '01] first byte of RC4(0||k) ... RC4(10^6||k) => you can find k

Hardware stream ciphers
  LFSRs
  How they were badly used in DVD CSS, A5/1, Bluetooth E0

Good ciphers?
  ESTREAM project
  Trivium, well-designed for shift registers
  Different ciphers to be used on processors with word/double-word
  granularity
  For software implementation, Salsa20

Random bit generation
1. s/w generated: RFC 4086, NIST SP-800-90
entropy collector on a loop --> rng state (always xor new information so
that entropy can only increase)
- interrupt times
- scheduler

Linux /dev/random blocks, /dev/urandom never blocks 
OpenBSD had a bug

Windows has CNG (Crypto Next Generation) BCryptGenRandom (NIST SP-800)

2. h/w generated;
i810 chipset on Intel, unfortunately not used anymore
Thermal noise off of two transistors and then extractor applied

von Neumann extractor
01 sequence with bias p 
extractor (b1...b2n): for i=1 to 2n by 2, if bibi+1 = "01" output 1 else
output 0
rate was 75 kbps

glib() not cryptographically random
math.random() in js is not implemented correctly in (say) Safari

Block ciphers
DES - classic block cipher
History: LUCIFER cipher by IBM 1967 (128 bits key/block size)

Abstraction of block cipher -- PRPs and PRFs. Formal syntactic and semantic
definitions

Pseudorandom Functions and Pseudorandom Permutations
F: K x X --> K

Security of PRFs -- indistinguishability of real world from ideal world

PRF switching lemma

Multi-message and single message definitions of security. CPA security.
Semantic security and the security of the OTP

Modes of operation, single message
1. ECB
2. Single-Key per use
3. Deterministic counter mode

Corresponding single message security definition

Modes of operation, multiple messages

Corresponding multiple messages definition

1. Nonce-based encryption
(k, n) pair is never ever reused
pick from sufficiently large space randomly, or use a counter
2. CBC with IV
